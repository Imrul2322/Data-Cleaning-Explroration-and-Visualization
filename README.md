# SQL-portfolio-project

## Environment
Here I worked with COVID-19 death and vaccination dataset from Feb 2020 to June 2022. Big dataset, so I used cloud SQL on GCP for faster queries.
My machine is not with high-end configuration and it was taking long time to load csv file into MySQL server. 
I used MySQL WorkeBench, connected with cloud SQL. 

It was a great experience.
Most importantly, running queries are so fast!


## works done

### 1. 'Data Exploration SQL' 
Here, I included all SQL codes I used to explore the dataset. Created queries to extract specific information I want. I used sub-queries, partitions, join, CTE, temp table and lot more. 

### 2.
